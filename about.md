### Research background and areas
With a background in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, Susie Rao is now working as a Data Science researcher at the [Chair of Applied Economics](https://cae.ethz.ch) and a PhD candidate at the [DS3Lab](ds3lab.org) under the co-supervision [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=GkXqbmMAAAAJ&hl=en) (technical) and [Prof. Peter Egger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lc6rZrgAAAAJ&hl=en) (domain). She graduated from the Institute of Computational Linguistics of the University of Zurich (Director: [Prof. Martin Volk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8bPj2w4AAAAJ&hl=en)).


Her research interests are dynamic network analysis, information extraction, natural language processing and their applicability to various domains such as bibliometrics, e-commerce, and applied economics. 

She has been working on the following research projects: 
- pattern matching and record linkage in large databases, e.g.,
  - [record linkage in Chinese firm-level and transaction-level DBs](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17538963.2021.1963046) (finalized); 

- information extraction and categorization in legal text such as international investment treaties and court cases, e.g.,
  - [Automatic Labeling of Articles in International Investment Agreements (Machine Learning and Word Embeddings)](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/228391/3/jurix30_xrao_almostready.pdf.pdf) (finalized); 

- fraud detection, e.g.,
  - [xFraud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12193) (finalized); 
  - [Dynamic HGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10831) (finalized);
  - [Real-time fraud detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13084.pdf) (finalized);

- topology and endogeneity of firm-product-trade network and discipline connectedness in the "Web" of Science as well as the interplay between patents and scholarly publications (ongoing). 
  - [Hierarchical classification of subfields in CS/Econ](Arxiv).
